# Exercism - TypeScript

Exercises from the [TypesScript track of exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript/).

## devcontainer

This project relies on [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/).

> [!NOTE]
> To enable this functionality in VS Code,
> install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers);
> this extension is included in the [Remote Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack).

### Exercism

The devcontainer also includes the Exercism CLI.

The [Exercism CLI Integration VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=exercism.exercism-cli) is also included.
The initial run of the devcontainer should prompt you to:
- verify the Exercism CLI is installed
- supply your [Exercism API/CLI Token](https://exercism.org/settings/api_cli)

[!IMPORTANT]
> Do NOT select a track through the extension.

Configure the Exercism workspace: `exercism configure --workspace /workspaces/exercism-typescript/exercises/`
